# Sage at TAPIA 2024

![tapia presenters](img/tapia2024/tapia-presenters.jpg)

Sponsored by [Sage NDC-C](https://nairrpilot.org/projects/demo/sage), we presented the Sage edge computing platform and self-supervised learning at the edge in the TAPIA conference (See [the presentation slides](workshop-pdfs/TAPIA-sep-2024.pdf)). In the workshop, we met many acamedia professors, computer scientists, and students and received their passion on being engaged and sharing their research problems with us. We look forward to future collaborations with them!
